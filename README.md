# Fresh Basket
One-stop shop for all your grocery needs.  
May 01, 2023
### Overview
Fresh Basket is an online grocery shopping platform that allows users to shop for groceries from home and have them delivered to their doorstep. The project aims to solve the problem of long wait times and queues in grocery stores and to make grocery shopping more convenient and accessible for everyone.
### Team
Theodore Gift Tsori: Full-stack Developer.
The Fresh Basket team comprises a single full-stack developer with expertise in multiple areas, including frontend development, backend development, and project management.
### Technologies
Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python
Frameworks: React, Flask
Libraries: Axios, Redux, Material-UI
Database: MySQL
Tools: Git, GitHub, VS Code, Heroku
While Angular was an option for the frontend framework, React was chosen due to the developer’s experience and the project’s specific requirements. PostgreSQL was another option for the database, but MySQL was selected due to its flexibility and scalability.
### Challenge
The Fresh Basket project aims to solve the problem of long wait times and queues in grocery stores. It provides an online platform for customers to shop for groceries from home and have them delivered to their doorstep.
However, the project will not solve the problem of physical store visits for customers who prefer to shop in person. The project will help busy individuals who don't have the time to physically shop for groceries and the elderly and disabled who may have difficulty leaving their homes.
The project is relevant to anyone with an internet connection.
### Risks
The Fresh Basket project faces a number of risks, including:
Technical risks: Issues with API integration and scalability
Non-technical risks: Delivery delays and customer satisfaction issues
#### Mitigation Strategies
The Fresh Basket team will mitigate these risks by:
Conducting rigorous testing
Using cloud-based services for hosting and scaling
Working with trusted delivery partners
Maintaining open communication with customers
### Infrastructure
The Fresh Basket team will use the following infrastructure:
Version control: Gitflow branching model
Deployment: Continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) using Heroku
Data: Product information from grocery stores and suppliers
Testing: Automated unit and integration tests using jest and Enzyme
### Existing Solutions
There are a number of existing solutions that are similar to Fresh Basket, including Amazon Fresh, Instacart, and Walmart Grocery. However, Fresh Basket will differentiate itself by providing a personalized shopping experience and real-time stock availability information for each store. Additionally, Fresh Basket will allow users to shop from multiple stores in one order, making it more convenient for users.
### Conclusion
The Fresh Basket project has the potential to solve a real problem for many people. The team has the expertise and experience necessary to make the project a success. By mitigating the risks and using the right technologies and infrastructure, the Fresh Basket team can create a platform that makes grocery shopping more convenient and accessible for everyone.
